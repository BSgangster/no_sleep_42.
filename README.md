## Aim of this repo?

* Tackling 42's curriculum. And most of all to learn new things and teach new things to others, hence why all my code will have comments(Soon:D)

## Projects(so far):

* [Libft](libft2/)

* [headerfile_maker](headerfile_maker/)

* [ft_printf](ft_printf/)

* [ft_ls](ft_ls/)

* [get_next_line](get_next_line/)

## Rules

<b>There are no ru...Nah, in a world full of chaos you gotta keep order, so here we go:</b>    
* Comment your code always, not everyone's code is completely readable, unless you write in python ^^
* Please add you name , when you commit. Add it after a dash preferably, eg, '- Kobus'
* Question other people's code, try to improve it, use a faster algorithm to impove time complexity or even space      complexity in some cases, however please have your reasons when u change code.
* Email bubblesortguru@gmail.com if you want to collab :)
