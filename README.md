## Aim of this repo?

Well it's simple. Working together to tackle wethinkcode curriculum(Or basically tackling 42's). We can all add and push on this repo, just remember to comment your code make it easier for everyone.

## Projects(so far):

* [Libft](libft/)

## Rules

There are no ru...Nah, in a world full of chaos you gotta keep order, so here we go:
                * Comment your code always, not everyone's code is completely readable, unless you write in python ^^
                * Please add you name , when you commit. Add it after a dash preferably, eg, '- Kobus'
                * Question other people's code, try to improve it, use a faster algorithm to impove time complexity or even space                           complexity in some cases, however please have your reasons when u change code.
                * Please do not mess up the repo man, this is people's hardword :)
