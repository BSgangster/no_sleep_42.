* Please be aware that this project has nothing to do with 42, it's mine, built by myself to decrease workload and increase dev time.

* Please put this file inside of your src directory where all your c files are.
* Execute it with 'python file_name.py' unfortunetely you need python 2.7 (But If needed i can code a python3 version as well).
* Please, do not leave this in your src directory or push it with your files. You will get KO'ed for it.
