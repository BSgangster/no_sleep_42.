## Libft description

* A project where we have to use the C bootcamp we did, do build a library based on the standard C library functions.

* NB! for the guys working on this please do remember this is library, please import libft.h in al you code and reuse things we've already made. Hence why we include libft.h, our own library.

* Will not push bonus content until I've test them well :)
